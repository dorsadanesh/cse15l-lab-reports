* The website to install is https://code.visualstudio.com/, and it has all the installation instructions
* Once installed, opening VSC will lead to this:

# Remotely Connecting
* Once installed, open a terminal so we can connect to a remote computer
* First you have to type in the ssh command into the terminal
* In this specific lab, the command we entered was: ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu (replacing zz with our specific account letter)
* You'll be given a message that looks like this (respond yes) and prompted to enter your password

* After that, you've logged in and are now connected to another computer
## Trying Some Commands
* A couple commands we were given to try in lab were:
* cd ~
* cd
* ls -lat
* ls -a
* cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt ~/
* cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt
## Moving Files with scp
* Now we're gonna copy files over, so begin by creating a file such as the following and compile it with javac and java commands
