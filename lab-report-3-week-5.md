# Lab Report 3
## Researching Commands

Consider the command grep. It stands for "global regular expression print" and searches for the pattern within a given set of files.

Find 3 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose. 
1. grep -
- grep -v
- grep -n
- grep -c
2. grep “^/$” 
- grep “^hello” 
- e
- e
3. grep “[a-e]”
- e
- e
- e

For example, we saw the -name option for find in class. For each of those options, give 3 examples of using it on files and directories from ./technical. Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output, and write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s useful.
